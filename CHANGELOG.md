## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.2] - 2022-01-13
### Fixed
- Support strings for predictions in array-like structures

## [0.3.1] - 2022-11-24
### Fixed
- Assume that prediction output field(s) may be nullable. It's not uncommon to want ML models to return null or nan values at inference time (e.g. extrapolation outside of training data range).
- Coerce nan values in output to null in JSON

## [0.3.0] - 2022-10-07
### Added
- Support for multiple model outputs by handling `PyFuncModel`s that return `pandas.Series` or `pandas.DataFrame`

### Fixed
- Explicitly cast DataFrame column types before applying model to handle downcast of 32-bit integers.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-08-12
### Changed
- Return an object in JSON APIs, rather than arrays of objects. This provides better interoperability with JVM based clients using the popular Jackson object mapper.

### Fixed
- Unpin FastAPI dependency to benefit from future upgrades

## [0.1.2] - 2022-03-04
### Added
- Explicit license and Copyright statement
- Link to repository in package metadata

## [0.1.1] - 2022-03-04
### Changed
- Improved documentation in the README for public release

### Fixed
- Typing annotations, checked with mypy 

## [0.1.0] - 2022-01-28
### Added
- Basic functionality to build a predictor callable and an app
